# AI_Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and AI projects I've worked on.

Some of them are from online competitions (like Kaggle), while others are training exercises or experiments I've done just for fun.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a personal portfolio of learning, experimentation, and problem-solving in the field of applied machine learning.  
It's also a space where I try out new ideas and approaches for improving models, tuning, and pipeline design.
